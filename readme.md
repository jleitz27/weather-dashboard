# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
To show current weather and the 5 day forcast for multiple cities to be able to plan a trip accordingly

## Criteria

There is a weather dashboard with form inputs. When the user searches for a city they are presented with the current weather and future conditions and city is added to search history. Then the user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, the UV index, and the 5 day forcast for that city. If the user clicks on a city from the search history then the previous conditions are shown for that city.
